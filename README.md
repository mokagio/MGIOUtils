MGIOUtils
=========

> Two simple categories to make searching, opening, reading, and writing on files in iOS a one line operation.

For the moment you'll have to _use the source_, young padawan. `NSFileManager+MGIOUtils` provides quick methods to find out if a file exists, and it's path. `NSObject+MGIOUtils` has a lot of methods to write and read `NSArray` and `NSDictionaries` to files. Any many more handy things!
